## Overview

This project demonstrates setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a Python application using GitHub Actions. The CI/CD pipeline automatically runs tests and ensures code quality whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Features

- **Automated Testing:** The CI/CD pipeline runs unit tests using `pytest` whenever changes are pushed or a pull request is made.
- **Python 3.12 Compatibility:** The project is set up to work with Python 3.12.
- **GitHub Actions:** Integrated with GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD.
- **Docker Support:** (Optional) The project is structured to easily add Docker support if needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12**: You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip**: Python package installer.
- **Git**: Version control system.

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-python-app.git
   cd ci-cd-python-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

   Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   To run the application:

   ```bash
   python app/main.py
   ```

4. **Run the Tests**

   To run the unit tests locally:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The pipeline is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file and performs the following steps:

- **Checkout Code:** Checks out the repository code.
- **Set Up Python:** Sets up the Python environment based on the specified version.
- **Install Dependencies:** Installs the required Python packages.
- **Run Tests:** Executes the unit tests using `pytest`.

The pipeline is triggered on:

- **Push:** When changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
- **Pull Request:** When a pull request is made to the `main` branch.

### Customizing the CI/CD Pipeline

To customize the CI/CD pipeline, modify the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

For example, to change the Python version:

```yaml
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'  # Change this to your desired version
```

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```
4. Push to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Create a pull request against the `main` branch.

### Additional Notes:

- **Badges:** Replace the badge URLs with your own, especially the CI badge (`![CI](https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-python-app/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)`). This URL will be available after your first GitHub Actions run.
- **Customization:** Adjust the setup instructions according to your specific requirements or environment.
